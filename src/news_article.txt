“We strive for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification on our residential projects, which is the most widely used green building rating system in the world,” she said. “We’re also under predevelopment design for the Southeast’s first environment, social and governance (ESG)-focused living experience with the goal of cutting the carbon footprint of building supplies.”
